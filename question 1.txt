1A An algorithm is a step by step procedure which follows a given set of instructions to produce a definite output, hence solving a given problem.
example; write an algorithm to subtract two numbers

         1 Start
         2 Declare three variables p, y, z
         3 assign a value to p,y
         4 z=p-y
         5 print (z)
         6 Stop 
1B A pseudocode is a statement which shows how the code would execute but is not dependent on the programming language

1D Properties of an algorithm include;
   input: the algorithm must have an input with values from a specified set
   output: the output values are the solution to the problem
   finiteness
   definiteness
   effectiveness
   independent

1E  Start(launch jupyter notebook)
          Declare three variables p, y, z
          assign a value to p,y
          z=p+y
          print z
    Stop 


     p= 1
     y= 2
     z=p+y
      print(z)

1F  pseudo code to add two numbers
       input p 
       input y
       z=p+y
       output z
